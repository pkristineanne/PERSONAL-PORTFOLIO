        Hi there! 👋 I'm a Railway Engineering graduate with a deep passion for creating and designing things on my computer. While my background is in engineering, I've found my creative spark in web development and graphic design, where I get to bring ideas to life through code and visuals.

        Beyond the digital world, I have a sweet tooth and an undeniable love for chocolates and sweets 🍫🍩—they fuel both my creativity and my late-night coding sessions!
        </div>
        <div>
        I’m always eager to learn new skills, take on exciting projects, and explore innovative ways to blend engineering, design, and technology. Let’s create something amazing together! 🚀
